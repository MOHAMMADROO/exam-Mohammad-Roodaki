                    Aston Martin UK cars have always been synonymous with luxury and beauty. But this veteran manufacturer had never produced an example to compete with the sports supercars of neighboring countries. This practice changed in 2016 with the introduction of the AM-RB 001 concept model. This concept car, which was a joint product of Aston Martin and Redbull, was renamed after some time and is now named Valkyrie among the most expensive cars of 2023.
                    Aston Martin Valkyrie is designed in two standard variants, coupe and open-top, and AMR Pro for the race track. The standard model benefits from a giant V12 engine with a volume of 6.5 liters and an electric motor made by Rimac (the manufacturer of the Nora model, which is also among the most expensive cars of 2023), which is naturally aspirated and has a total power of about 1,160 horses. Steam produces 10,500 rpm and a maximum torque of more than 900 newton meters. The production force is directly transferred to the rear wheels by a 7-speed automatic gearbox.
                    With this engine, Valkyrie accelerates from 0 to 100 in about 2.5 seconds and has a maximum speed of more than 370 km/h, making it one of the best sports cars. The optimizations of the AMR Pro model, in addition to the body decorations, suspension and brakes, as well as the reduction of seats from 2 to 1, have also been on the engine, which has increased its power, which, due to the reduction in weight, has a far more extraordinary performance than the model. It will be street and with a maximum speed of about 402 kilometers per hour, it will be called one of the fastest cars in the world in 2023.

The 8-cylinder 5.0-liter twin turbo engine has the ability to produce about 1,185 hp with regular fuel and 1,385 hp with E85 fuel, and its torque output is 1,385 newton meters.
